# Welcome to JohnnyDoer's Homelab!

Hello readers! Welcome to my homelab/automation/cybersecurity documentation.

### Introduction

I have been wanting to build a homelab ever since I came across the YouTube channels such as [TechnoTim](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnoTim), [HardwareHaven](https://www.youtube.com/@HardwareHaven), [WolfgangsChannel](https://www.youtube.com/@WolfgangsChannel), etc. and that dream finally came true in the beginning of 2024. My goals with this homelab is:

* Host services for learning about VMs, containers, self-hosting and stuff and also to use those services to make my life easier.
* Create automations to be able to recreate this homelab setup whenever and wherever required (given it has the required hardware).
* Create a cybersecurity playground where I can deploy vulnerable machines, attack these machines from an attacker machine and detect/prevent these attacks using blue team tools.

I am an advocate of open source software and therefore, almost all of the software that I will be using/deploying will be free and open source.
